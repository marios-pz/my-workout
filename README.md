## Disclaimer: 
- I precisely searched for uncopyrighted images, if the backround image is copyrighted. 
  Not my problem! ðŸ˜‰ __It will not__ going to be used for commercial purposes.
  
## To make the whole thing work you need to:
- `docker pull mongodb:5.0` (hostname must be named bibi, else use my compose are reference)
- `docker pull mariospapaz/api-workout:1.0`
- `docker pull mariospapaz/my-workout:1.0`

I highly suggest you to take my 
<a href="https://github.com/mariospapaz/my-workout/blob/main/visitors.yaml"> 
    Visitors yaml
</a>
instead, running all of these seperaly is a nuisance.

This is my first svelte project, if the webapp image seems not minimal to you. blame node-modules and my lack of experience :')
